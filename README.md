# Stata command for working with WIDA ACCESS DATA
The `widalookup` command is used to automate and standardize the creation of a data set that can be used for lookups when converting students' raw scaled score differences and starting proficiency levels into growth percentile bands. Options are provided that will build lookup tables for labeled values and a main table that can be used to look up the percentile growth bands in an SQL backend.
